Hi! My name is Senthil Rajasekaran and I am a final-year PhD student at Rice University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Moshe Vardi](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/moshe-y-vardi). My research interests include multi-agent systems, game theory, complexity theory, automata theory, and, in general, theoretical computer science and mathematics.

More information about my research can be found on my [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/283/4411.html) and my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NAz7IBwAAAAJ&hl=en). For information about unpublished work or work in submission, take a look at short CV.

For a broad look at my research, check out [this talk I gave at the Simons Institute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RBoaPIrvQY) or [this news article](https://csweb.rice.edu/news/quantitative-goal-approach-game-theory-problem-could-be-important-building-block) from Rice CS News.

Thank you for visiting my website!
