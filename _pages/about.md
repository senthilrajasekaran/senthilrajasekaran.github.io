Hi! My name is Senthil Rajasekaran and I am a final-year PhD student at Rice University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Moshe Vardi](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/moshe-y-vardi). My research interests include multi-agent systems, game theory, complexity theory, automata theory, and, in general, theoretical computer science and mathematics.

More information about my research can be found on my [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/283/4411.html) and my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NAz7IBwAAAAJ&hl=en). If you're interested in reading my papers, check out this [arXiv listing](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?query=Rajasekaran%2C+Senthil&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50), though I only add papers to arXiv that appear in formal proceedings. For information about unpublished work or work in submission, take a look at my [CV](/files/Senthil_Rajasekaran_CV_Mar2025.pdf).

For a broad look at my research, check out [this talk I gave at the Simons Institute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RBoaPIrvQY) or [this news article](https://csweb.rice.edu/news/quantitative-goal-approach-game-theory-problem-could-be-important-building-block) from Rice CS News.

Thank you for visiting my website!
