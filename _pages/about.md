Hi! My name is Senthil Rajasekaran and I am a final-year PhD student at Rice University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Moshe Vardi](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/moshe-y-vardi). My research interests include multi-agent systems, game theory, complexity theory, automata theory, and, in general, theoretical computer science and mathematics.
